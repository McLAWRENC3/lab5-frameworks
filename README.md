## Project Overview
This lab demonstrates the use of Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and React.js to build styled and interactive web pages.


## Tools Used and My Experience

### 1. Bootstrap
Used to create a responsive layout with a navbar, two-column grid, and styled components like buttons and alerts.  
My experience: Easy to use with pre-built components. Great for quick layout design.

### 2. Tailwind CSS
Built a responsive card-style section using utility classes for styling.  
My experience: Easy to use with pre-built components. Great for quick layout design.
 Very flexible. Utility-first approach made it easy to customize without writing custom CSS.

### 3. React.js
Created a functional component that displays a welcome message and toggles content using `useState`.  
My experience: Easy to use with pre-built components. Great for quick layout design.
Enjoyed the declarative approach. React makes interactivity straightforward using props and state.
